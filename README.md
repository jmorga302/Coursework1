## Information
This is a java program that you can use via the command line to covert integers into hexadecimal using the Dec2Hex.java file, passing in your input in the form "java Dec2Hex.java **input**".
There is also a test file named "Dec2HexTest.java" which contains a class with test methods in which can be called using the "TestRunner.java" file which then runs these tests and displays their results.
In order to run the tests on this file you must first run the code "javac -cp .:.junit4.10/junit-4.10.jar *.java" and then "java -cp .:.junit4.10/junit-4.10.jar TestRunner.java".
